The stopwatch widget function, represented by the <MyCustomWidget /> component, is one of the widgets in the application. Let's break down its functionality in detail:

Import statement:

The component imports the necessary dependencies and libraries, although the specific code for the stopwatch widget is not included in the code snippet you provided. The import statement for the stopwatch widget component is missing.
Widget object:

In the widgets array of the state, there is a widget object representing the stopwatch widget. The object contains properties such as id, component, area, and name. The component property is assigned with the <MyCustomWidget /> component, indicating that it is the component responsible for rendering the stopwatch widget.
Widget container:

Within the JSX code, there is a section that handles the rendering of the stopwatch widget within its corresponding widget container. This section is enclosed in a <div> element with the class name 'left-widget'.
Widget options:

The widget container contains a select dropdown element that allows the user to change the widget's area. The current value of the select element is determined by the widget.area property.
When the user selects a different area for the widget, the onChange event is triggered, and a function is called to update the widgetList and widgets state. The selected area value is assigned to widgetList[index].area, and then the setWidgets(widgetList) function is called to update the state.
Close button:
The widget container also includes a "Close" button with an onClick event handler. When the button is clicked, the removeWidget() function is called with the widget.id as the argument to remove the widget from the widgets state.
Custom Stopwatch Widget Component:

The <MyCustomWidget /> component represents the stopwatch widget itself. 
Overall, the stopwatch widget allows the user to interact with it by changing its area, moving it within the specified area (thanks to the Draggable component), and removing it from the application. However, without the implementation code for the stopwatch widget component, it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation of its specific functionality and behavior.
